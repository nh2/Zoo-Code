/**
 * Matching of file paths against user-configured file patterns.
 *
 * This is used to grant an access permission for a few named files instead of
 * for the whole workspace, for example `allowedWriteFiles`, which lists the
 * files Zoo may create or edit without asking.
 *
 * The syntax is gitignore-inspired, but deliberately differs from it in how a
 * path is anchored, because these patterns can name files anywhere on the
 * filesystem rather than only inside one repository:
 *
 * | Pattern               | Matches                                          |
 * | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
 * | `notes.md`            | that filename in any directory of the workspace  |
 * | `*.md`                | any such file in any directory of the workspace  |
 * | `docs/notes.md`       | that path relative to the workspace root         |
 * | `docs/scratch/**`     | everything below that workspace directory        |
 * | `./notes.md`          | that file in the workspace root only             |
 * | `../shared/notes.md`  | that path next to the workspace                  |
 * | `/tmp/notes.md`       | that absolute path (`/` is the filesystem root)  |
 * | `C:/tmp/notes.md`     | that absolute path on Windows                    |
 * | `~/notes.md`          | that path in the user's home directory           |
 * | `!docs/secret.md`     | excludes a file matched by an earlier pattern    |
 *
 * The differences from gitignore are all about reaching outside the workspace,
 * which gitignore has no need to do. Of the three spellings below, gitignore
 * accepts each without complaint and then matches nothing with it:
 * - `/notes.md` is an absolute filesystem path, whereas gitignore would read it
 *   as the workspace root. Absolute paths have to be expressible, and `/` is the
 *   spelling users expect for them.
 * - `./notes.md` anchors to the workspace root, the role gitignore gives to
 *   `/notes.md`.
 * - `../shared/notes.md` is resolved against the workspace root, so it names a
 *   path outside the workspace. For gitignore, `..` is a literal segment that no
 *   path inside the repository can match.
 *
 * `/` is the only directory separator, also on Windows, since a backslash
 * escapes the character after it.
 *
 * # Why patterns and paths are rewritten before matching
 *
 * The `ignore` library matches a path against patterns as `git` does against
 * `.gitignore` entries, so both have to be relative to, and below, one base
 * directory. It therefore cannot handle:
 * - absolute paths (`/tmp/notes.md`, `C:/tmp/notes.md`), or
 * - paths that climb out of the base directory (`../shared/notes.md`).
 * Running `ignore`'s matching ()`ignores()`) against such a path throws
 * `RangeError` ("path should be a `path.relative()`d string").
 * Passing such a *pattern* to `add()` throws nothing at all:
 * It is accepted and then quietly never matches, which would
 * turn a mistyped permission into a silent no-op.
 *
 * Both the configured patterns and the path being checked are therefore
 * rewritten into a single form the library accepts: a path relative to the
 * filesystem root (`/`), with any Windows drive as its first segment.
 *
 * An alternative implementation would be to remember for each pattern whether
 * it's a workspace-scoped pattern or an absolute-filesystem pattern, and then
 * run `ignore` twice, with different base dirs. We do not do that because it
 * makes implementing negation patterns (`!`) harder, as `ignore` checks for
 * negations only within the given set of patterns; if we had 2 such sets (one
 * for workspace, one for absolute), then an absolute negation pattern like
 * `!/path/to/my/repo/secret.txt` would surprisingly not deny a relative pattern
 * such as `*.txt`, because those would be handled by different `ignore`
 * instances.

/**
 * Rewrite a user-supplied pattern so that it matches the root-relative paths
 * produced by `toMatcherPath()`.
 *
 * Patterns that name a directory rather than a file are rejected (`undefined`).
 *
 * The workspace root (`cwd`) is normally known, but is absent when no folder is
 * open in VS Code, and in contexts that build the extension state without one.
 * Without it, a workspace-relative pattern is rejected rather than matched
 * loosely: there is no workspace for it to be relative to, and a bare gitignore
 * pattern matches in *any* directory, so `passwd` would otherwise match
 * `/etc/passwd`, and a bare `*` would match every file on the machine.
 * That would be quite a footgun.
 * Only absolute patterns remain usable in that situation.
 *
 * When the root is known, a workspace-relative pattern has that root prefixed
 * onto it, which puts it in the same form as an absolute one. gitignore anchors
 * any pattern that has a separator at its beginning or middle, so prefixing turns
 * a bare filename such as `notes.md`, which is meant to match in any directory,
 * into a workspace-root-only match. Its reach is restored by inserting a `/**`
 * segment (whose trailing slash cannot be written in this comment, as it would
 * close the comment block) between the root and the filename: that wildcard stands
 * for any number of directories including none, so the result matches
 * `base/notes.md` as well as `base/a/b/notes.md`.
 *
 * In the below examples, `(star-star)` stands for the `**` wildcard,
 * which cannot be written literally here because its trailing slash
 * would close the JSDoc comment block.
 *
 * Examples (home directory `/home/me`).
 * - For workspace root `cwd = "/path/to/repo"`:
 *   - `"notes.md"` -> `"/path/to/repo/(star-star)/notes.md"`
 *   - `"*.md"` -> `"/path/to/repo/(star-star)/*.md"`
 *   - `"docs/notes.md"` -> `"/path/to/repo/docs/notes.md"`
 *   - `"docs/scratch/**"` -> `"/path/to/repo/docs/scratch/**"`
 *   - `"./notes.md"` -> `"/path/to/repo/notes.md"`
 *   - `"../shared/notes.md"` -> `"/path/to/shared/notes.md"`
 *     resolved against the workspace root, so it lands outside the workspace
 *   - `"~/notes.md"` -> `"/home/me/notes.md"`
 *   - `"C:/tmp/notes.md"` -> `"/c:/tmp/notes.md"`
 *   - `"!docs/secret.md"` -> `"!/path/to/repo/docs/secret.md"`
 *   - `"mydir/"` -> `undefined` (because it names a dir)
 *   - `"~"` -> `undefined` (because it names a dir)
 * - For workspace root `cwd = undefined`:
 *   - `"notes.md"` with no workspace root -> `undefined`
 *     (as is any workspace-relative pattern, see above)
 *
 * Whitespace and backslashes are left as typed, because the `ignore` library
 * applies gitignore's own rules to them: leading whitespace is part of the
 * filename, trailing whitespace is dropped unless escaped (`"notes.md\ "`), and
 * a backslash escapes the character after it. Only patterns consisting solely of
 * whitespace are rejected, since they name no file.
 *
 * @param pattern - Raw pattern as typed by the user.
 * @param cwd - Workspace root, used to resolve workspace-relative patterns.
 * @returns The rewritten pattern, or `undefined` when the pattern can never
 * match a file (empty, a directory, or escaping an unknown workspace root).
